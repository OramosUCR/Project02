This repository contains a computational review of the paper:

**Wright, M. N., & Ziegler, A. (2017). ranger: A Fast Implementation of Random Forests for High Dimensional Data in C++ and R. *Journal of Statistical Software*, 77(1), 1-17.**

##Overview
This document includes background on random forests, a detailed review of computational methods and optimizations, technical demonstrations with classification and regression examples, and a critical discussion of achievements and limitations.


## Requirements

The report requires the following R packages:
- `ranger`: Fast random forest implementation
- `ggplot2`: For visualizations
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation
- `microbenchmark`: For performance comparisons

Install with:
```r
install.packages(c("ranger", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "microbenchmark"))
```
